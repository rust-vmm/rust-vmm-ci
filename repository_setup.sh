Welcome to the rust-vmm interactive repository setup!

This script will guide you through initializing basic components of a fresh
rust-vmm repository, or alternatively lets you update the configuration of an
existing repository (for example, if since the first setup of a repository,
rust-vmm-ci has added new features that you would like to use).
